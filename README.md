This is the beginning of a library for the reading and writing of MPEG2-TS (transport stream) file. It's a long spec,
so this is far from complete. Currently only reading is supported. You can test it using tests/load_test_file.py,
pointing at whatever .ts file you may care to try. It'll consume the file and give you timing output at the end.
